## Go-Pagify
### Currently abandoned
This was a fun experiment while it lasted, but I've been stonewalled for far too long. Ultimately,?pagination has too many factors for a very strict language like Go to be able to dynamically account for without the end user having to write more code than it would take to just write a standard paging algorithm.
